# Absorption Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
<hline>
A simple module for estimating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the context of resonant absorption imaging. The SNR corresponds to the extracted column density of a cold atomic cloud.
 
Instructions:

1. Clone the repository using:
``` git clone htttps://github.com/pacosalces/absorption_SNR.git```

2. Run the ```python absorption_snr.py``` script, and start experimenting! 

Contributions welcome! Ideally open an issue if you run into trouble!
